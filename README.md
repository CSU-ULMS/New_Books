# New_Books
Scripts to display new books added to CSU Collections.  In this implementation, the NewBooksTable.php file serves as a view for multiple Analytics queries (as can be pulled from a separate file).
# IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
1: CREATE YOUR ANALYTICS QUERY.  These should be based on items added recently filtered by call number.
